# Electric-Vehicle-Population-Data-Excel
🔋 Project Title: Electric Vehicle Population Data Analysis Using Excel
📘 Project Description:
This project involves the analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) Population Data using Microsoft Excel to explore trends in EV adoption, manufacturer performance, and regional distribution. The goal is to use Excel’s powerful data tools—such as pivot tables, charts, filters, and conditional formatting—to extract actionable insights from real-world EV registration data.

The dataset includes information such as vehicle make, model, year, type (BEV/PHEV), electric range, and registration location.

📊 Key Project Tasks:
✅ Data Cleaning: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, standardize column formatting.

📌 Data Categorization: Classify vehicles by type (Battery Electric vs Plug-in Hybrid), model year, and region.

📈 Pivot Table Analysis:

Total EVs by year, make, model, and city/state

EV type distribution (BEV vs PHEV)

Average electric range by model or year

📊 Charts and Graphs:

Column charts to show top EV manufacturers

Line charts for year-wise growth

Pie charts to represent EV type shares

🖌️ Dashboard Creation:

Interactive summary with slicers and filters

Key metrics like total EVs, top models, range averages

🧰 Tools & Excel Features Used:
Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts

Conditional Formatting

Data Validation & Drop-downs

Filters, Sort, IF formulas, COUNTIFS/SUMIFS

Dashboard Design with Slicers and Dynamic Charts

🔍 Insights You Can Derive:
Which manufacturers are leading in EV registrations

Which cities or states have the highest EV adoption

How electric vehicle technology (range, type) has evolved over time

Year-over-year growth rate of EV registrations

🎯 Learning Outcomes:
Practical experience in data analysis using Excel

Improved skills in building interactive dashboards

Understanding of trends in sustainable transportation

Ability to turn raw data into visual business insights
